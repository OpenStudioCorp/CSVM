# Whats this for?

Welcome to the C++ Section of the CubeScript Transpiler!

imagine this, your coding along in VSCode, IJ Rider, Emacs or Atom and you go to compile your code to test it.

when you run it however, you get told that the command doesnt work or that the command ran but it couldn't complete.

sounds like a courrpted Transpiler install right? yep, you got that correct!

this section of the CSVM transpiler is designed to be the seccond part within the toolchain, after running the first section, most notibly the CSharp start, this check runs to make sure that the Transpiler is installed correctly.
