## Introduction

 Welcome to the official CubeScript Code Controbutions page. This page will show you how to controbute to CubeScript and what the requirements are for CubeScript.
 this also applies to the official CubeScript Compiler.

## Code Controbutions

### Code Controbutions For CubeScript

thanks for wanting to controbute to CubeScript. here are the rules for controbutions.

1. you must have a GitHub account.
2. you must have a basic understanding of CubeScript.
3. if you want to controbute to the Compiler, you must have a basic understanding of the CubeScript Compiler.
4. you must have a basic understanding of the CubeScript Syntax.
5. you must have a basic understanding of the CubeScript Compiler Syntax.

if you meet all of these requirements, you can controbute to CubeScript. here are the rules for controbutions.

1. all methods must be documented and commented well.
2. all methods must be tested before being added to the main branch.
3. there should be a documentation file called CubeSript.doc.csc for the CubeScript Compiler. using that file, please create a new section following the format of the template.

## testing

for testing files and testing code, please use the tests folder while allowing the .gitignore file to keep the folder so that people can reuse the tests folder plus the tests inside the folder for testing code.

and yes this file is available on the website aswell as the github repo.
